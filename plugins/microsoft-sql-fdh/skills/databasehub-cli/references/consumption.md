# Database Hub consumption mode

Use this mode for estate discovery and inventory. Before issuing calls, apply
the lifecycle, identity, transport, pagination, partial-result, and read-only
rules in the API contract linked directly from `SKILL.md`.

## Workflow

1. Start with `/databases/count` to establish the total and type mix.
2. If the user asks only for totals, report `totalCount` and `countByType` and
   stop.
3. For mixed Estate V2 rows, use `/savedView/resources/list` with an immutable
   `overviewFilters` snapshot. Use `/databases/list` only for its legacy Azure
   SQL database / Arc SQL Server population.
4. Use hierarchy routes only to resolve a named Azure SQL database or to answer
   a subscription/resource-group/server hierarchy question.
5. Keep Fabric SQL catalog entries separate from Azure estate resources.
6. Report pagination completeness and any issue/enhancement fields returned
   with inventory rows.

## Inventory routes

| Method | Relative route | Request | Important response fields |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/subscriptions` | none | array of `subscriptionId`, `displayName`, `tenantId` |
| GET | `/databases/count` | none | `totalCount`, `countByType` |
| GET | `/databases/warning/count` | none | SQL/Arc-only `warningCount` |
| POST | `/databases/list` | legacy `databaseType?` (`AzureSql` or `ArcSqlServer`), `top` 1-1000, `continuationToken?` | SQL/Arc `databases[]`, `totalCount`, `hasMore`, `continuationToken` |
| POST | `/azuresql/list` | required `resourceType`, `includeHealthData?`, `pageSize?`, `continuationToken?` | `resourceType`, `resources[]`, `totalCount`, `continuationToken` |
| POST | `/postgreSql/list` | `pageSize?`, `continuationToken?` | `resources[]`, `totalCount`, `continuationToken` |
| POST | `/cosmosDb/list` | `pageSize?`, `continuationToken?` | `resources[]`, `totalCount`, `continuationToken` |
| POST | `/savedView/resources/list` | required `overviewFilters`, plus `pageSize?`, `continuationToken?` | mixed `resources[]`, `totalCount`, `continuationToken` |
| POST | `/fabric/list` | `search?`, `pageSize?`, `continuationToken?` | Fabric SQL catalog `value[]`, `continuationToken` |

For `pageSize`-based inventory routes, the default is 1000 and the valid range
is 1-1000. `/databases/list` is the exception: it uses `top` 1-1000 instead of
`pageSize`. Begin smaller when the user wants a summary rather than a full
export.

`/databases/count` and `/databases/list` do not have the same population.
Counts include broader Estate V2 types; the legacy list contains only Azure SQL
databases and Arc SQL Server instances. Never compare their totals as if they
were the same denominator.

### Legacy SQL/Arc inventory body

```json
{
  "top": 100
}
```

Omit `databaseType` for both legacy families, or use only `AzureSql` or
`ArcSqlServer`. Other enum values are unsupported on this route; use the
engine-specific or saved-view routes instead.

### Engine-specific inventory bodies

```json
{
  "pageSize": 100
}
```

PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB use that shape directly. Azure SQL also requires one
canonical ARM resource type:

| Resource | `resourceType` |
| --- | --- |
| Azure SQL databases | `microsoft.sql/servers/databases` |
| logical servers | `microsoft.sql/servers` |
| elastic pools | `microsoft.sql/servers/elasticpools` |
| Arc-enabled SQL Server instances | `microsoft.azurearcdata/sqlserverinstances` |
| SQL Server on Azure VMs | `microsoft.sqlvirtualmachine/sqlvirtualmachines` |
| managed instances | `microsoft.sql/managedinstances` |

Set `includeHealthData: true` only on `/azuresql/list`, and only when its
issue/enhancement flags are required. PostgreSQL and Cosmos inventory return
their supported finding flags without that property. Do not treat inventory
flags as a substitute for the operations health routes.

### Saved-view body

An empty immutable filter snapshot selects the supported mixed Estate V2
resource types:

```json
{
  "pageSize": 100,
  "overviewFilters": {}
}
```

Supported membership filters include `databaseTypes`, `statuses`,
`subscriptionIds`, `resourceGroups`, `locations`, structured `tags`, and
`skuTiers`.

```json
{
  "pageSize": 100,
  "overviewFilters": {
    "databaseTypes": ["AzureSql", "PostgreSql", "Cosmos"],
    "subscriptionIds": ["<subscription-guid>"],
    "tags": [
      {
        "key": "environment",
        "value": "production"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each tag filter requires `key`; omit `value` to match any value for that key.

When the user requests an exact number of pages, issue that many separate POST
requests and stop even if another token remains. Emit a compact result with
`pageCount`, `returnedRowCount`, `totalCount`, and the final
`continuationToken`. For example, two 10-row pages must report
`pageCount: 2` and `returnedRowCount: 20`; do not infer those values only in
the final prose.

`searchFindingKeys` is **not** a standalone finding-membership filter. It is
used only with a non-empty `searchTerm`, and active finding flags are OR'd into
that keyword search. Do not use it to claim that returned rows all have a
specific issue.

For named finding resources:

- performance high/low groups: use SQL or PostgreSQL `usage-details`;
- authentication, auditing, or CMK gaps: use the matching warning route; and
- other security findings: inspect `issues` / `enhancements` on engine-specific
  inventory. On `/azuresql/list`, request them with `includeHealthData: true`;
  PostgreSQL and Cosmos return supported flags without that property. Filter the
  returned rows client-side and state when no dedicated server-side membership
  route exists.

### Fabric SQL catalog body

```json
{
  "search": "",
  "pageSize": 100
}
```

Rows contain `id`, `type`, `catalogEntryType`, `displayName`, `description`, and
workspace hierarchy. This route is **inventory only**; hand off a selected
Fabric SQL database to an installed item-level SQL skill for T-SQL or
item-level diagnostics.

## Azure SQL hierarchy routes

| Method | Relative route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups` | list resource groups |
| GET | `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/servers` | list logical servers |
| GET | `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/servers/{serverName}/databases` | list database names |
| GET | `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/servers/{serverName}/databases/{databaseName}` | read one Azure SQL database from ARM |

Resolve names by listing and filtering. Never guess a subscription, resource
group, server, resource ID, workspace ID, or item ID.

## Security finding summaries

The overview summary routes currently support only the `security` category:

```text
GET /overviewFindings/security/{issues|suggestions}/summaries
GET /overviewFindings/security/{issues|suggestions}/{MicrosoftSql|PostgreSql|CosmosDb}/summary
```

Use `suggestions` in requests; the response can canonicalize that relevance to
`enhancements`. Important fields are `databaseFamily`, `totalFindingCount`,
`totalAffectedResourceCount`, `postureAffectedResourceCount`,
`affectedResourceCounts`, `targetSummaries`, and `errors`.

## Reporting contract

- Distinguish resource count from finding count: one resource can have multiple
  findings.
- Group by returned `type` or `databaseFamily`; do not infer an engine from a
  resource name.
- Include `totalCount` and whether every continuation token was consumed.
- State which population produced each total. In particular, do not present the
  legacy SQL/Arc list total as the broader `/databases/count` denominator.
- If inventory is empty, state the scope and filters used before concluding
  that no resources exist.
- If a resource name is duplicated, include server, subscription, resource
  group, workspace, or full resource ID as needed to disambiguate it.
